# Extras


## Registering a new Instructor

each course has a page that they can use to register a new Instructor. idk how secure it is, as idk who can see the repository, so when creating and running your own server, my suggestion getting rid of that get statement of change in the name of the link


## Home Page
There is not home page for the courses, they need to be made by who even maintans the course. there is code so that a file called "home.html" will be loaded if it exists in the course directory.


## lectures & the lecture Directory

So lectures need to be put in the lecture folder of there respective courses. the server will search for all files in the lecture folder, and output all html document. they will be sorted.
change how you wish, because how the lectures how up is based off the JS sort function.
